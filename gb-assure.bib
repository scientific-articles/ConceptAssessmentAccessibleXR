               several years, and is now in a phase where its principles and
               practices are maturing. The purpose of this paper is to describe
               the results of an industry survey aimed at understanding how
               maturation is progressing. The survey was taken across 40
               software development companies in Northern Ireland at the
               beginning of 2012. The paper describes the design of the survey
               and examines maturity by comparing the results obtained in 2012
               with those from a study of agile adoption in the same region in
               2010. Both surveys aimed to achieve comprehensive coverage of a
               single area rather than rely on a voluntary sample. The main
               outcome from the work is a collection of ``insights'' into the

  abstract = "PURPOSE: Universal design (UD) provides an explanation of good
              design based on the user perspective, which are outlined through
              its principles, goals, and related frameworks. The aim of this
              paper is to provide an overview of the frameworks and methods for
              UD building evaluations and to describe how close they have come
              to describing what a universally designed building is. METHODS:
              Evaluation approaches are reviewed from the existing literature
              across a number of spatial disciplines, including UD, human
              geography and urban studies. RESULTS: Four categories of UD
              evaluation methods are outlined, including (1) checklist
              evaluations, (2) value-driven evaluations, (3) holistic
              evaluations, and (4) invisible evaluations. CONCLUSIONS: A number
              of suggestions are made to aid research aimed at developing UD
              evaluation in buildings. (1) Design standards and guidelines
              should be contested or validated where possible; (2) evaluation
              criteria should be contextual; (3) it may be more practical to
              have separate methodologies for contextualising UD to allow for
              the creation of an evaluating tool that is practical in use.
              Additionally, there is a difficulty in establishing a clear basis
              for evaluating how empathetic buildings are without expanding the
              methodological horizons of UD evaluation. Implications for
              Rehabilitation For universal design (UD) evaluation to address
              human need requires methods that are culturally, temporally, and
              typologically specific. Practical instruments for measuring UD
              need to be divorced from but contingent upon methods than can
              address local specificities. The process of evaluation can
              provide knowledge that can contest or validate the literature
              based sources such as design guidelines, or standards. UD
              evaluation requires constant renewal by searching for new,
              flexible strategies that can respond to socio-cultural change.",

               complete, current, and authoritative introduction to
               user-interface design. The user interface is the part of every
               computer system that determines how people control and operate
               that system. When the interface is well designed, it is
               comprehensible, predictable, and controllable; users feel
               competent, satisfied, and responsible for their actions.
               Shneiderman discusses the principles and practices needed to
               design such effective interaction. Based on 20 years experience,
               Shneiderman offers readers practical techniques and guidelines
               for interface design. He also takes great care to discuss
               underlying issues and to support conclusions with empirical
               results. Interface designers, software engineers, and product
               managers will find this book an invaluable resource for creating
               systems that facilitate rapid learning and performance, yield
               low error rates, and generate high user satisfaction. Coverage

               in the research literature. In this study, we argue that a well
               designed computer system should realize the twin aims of
               enhancing performance and lowering stress. This paper reports on
               a psychophysiological field study of the implementation of a
               command-and-control system in an ambulance service. The
               evaluation revealed both improvements in operator performance
               and a reduction in stress levels. In particular, it was found
               that computer support reduced both systolic blood pressure and
               subjective anxiety during conditions of peak workload. These
               findings are discussed in terms of Turner and Karasek's
               integrated model of the relationships between computer system
               design, task performance and well-being. The success of the
               computer system was attributed to the support that it gave
               operators; by enhancing their degree of control it enabled them
               to cope better in a highly demanding work environment. The study

  abstract  = "Findings from research on false memory have major implications
               for a number of fields central to human welfare, such as
               medicine and law. Although many important conclusions have been
               reached after a decade or so of intensive research, the majority
               of them are not well known outside the immediate field. To make
               this research accessible to a much wider audience, The Science
               of False Memory has been written to require little or no
               background knowledge of the theory and techniques used in memory
               research. Brainerd and Reyna introduce the volume by considering
               the progenitors to the modern science of false memory, and
               noting the remarkable degree to which core themes of
               contemporary research were anticipated by historical figure such
               as Binet, Piaget, and Bartlett. They continue with an account of
               the varied methods that have been used to study false memory
               both inside and outside of the laboratory. The first part of the
               volume focuses on the basic science of false memory, revolving
               around three topics: old and new theoretical ideas that have
               been used to explain false memory and make predictions about it;
               research findings and predictions about false memory in normal
               adults; and research findings and predictions about age-related
               changes in false memory between early childhood and adulthood.
               Throughout Part I, Brainerd and Reyna emphasize how current
               opponent-processes conceptions of false memory act as a unifying
               influence by integrating predictions and data across disparate
               forms of false memory. The second part focuses on the applied
               science of false memory, revolving around four topics: the
               falsifiability of witnesses and suspects memories of crimes,
               including false confessions by suspects; the falsifiability of
               eyewitness identifications of suspects; false-memory reports in
               investigative interviews of child victims and witnesses,
               particularly in connection with sexual-abuse crimes; false
               memory in psychotherapy, including recovered memories of
               childhood abuse, multiple-personality disorders, and recovered
               memories of previous lives. Although Part II is concerned with
               applied research, Brainerd and Reyna continue to emphasize the
               unifying influence of opponent-processes conceptions of false
               memory. The third part focuses on emerging trends, revolving
               around three expanding areas of false-memory research:
               mathematical models, aging effects, and cognitive neuroscience.
               False Memory will be an invaluable resource for professional
               researchers, practitioners, and students in the many fields for
               which false-memory research has implications, including
               child-protective services, clinical psychology, law, criminal
               justice, elementary and secondary education, general medicine,

  abstract = "There is a large interest in user experience today, both from a
              usability and accessibility point of view. However, in order to
              verify what the users actually like and don't like, user testing
              must be conducted. Traditionally, user experience is measured
              retrospective with surveys and interviews, but this is not the
              most optimal approach since it does not measure user experience
              in the moment and it is prone for human error because of our
              inaccurate memory recollection. Here we propose a method that
              does semi-automated evaluation of user experience by utilizing
              electrophysiological equipment that monitors electrical activity
              of the brain. We describe an approach that together with brain
              activity monitoring will collect and quantify user experience in
              a non-intrusive manner. We demonstrate the method by showing how
              a low cost device can record brain activity during a user test,
              and auto-detect where the user has difficulties understand or
              navigating a solution. All this is done in an unsupervised
              manner, but an observer must still verify the feedback with the
              actual user to remove false positives. Our method is not limited

  abstract = {Human computer interaction is increasingly utilized in smart home, industry 4.0 and personal health. Communication between human and computer can benefit by a flawless exchange of emotions. As emotions have substantial influence on cognitive processes of the human brain such as learning, memory, perception and problem solving, emotional interactions benefit different applications. It can further be relevant in modern health care especially in interaction with patients suffering from stress or depression. Additionally rehabilitation applications, guiding patients through their rehabilitation training while adapting to the patients emotional state, would be highly motivating and might lead to a faster recovery. Depending on the application area, different systems for emotion recognition suit different purposes. The aim of this work is to give an overview of methods to recognize emotions and to compare their applicability based on existing studies. This review paper should enable practitioners, researchers and engineers to find a system most suitable for certain applications. An entirely contact-less method is to analyze facial features with the help of a video camera. This is useful when computers, smart-phones or tablets with integrated cameras are included in the task. Smart wearables provide contact with the skin and physiological parameters such as electro-dermal activity and heart related signals can be recorded unobtrusively also during dynamical tasks. Next to unimodal solutions, multimodal affective computing systems are analyzed since they promise higher classification accuracy. Accuracy varies based on the amount of detected emotions, extracted features, classification method and the quality of the database. Electroencephalography achieves 88.86 \% accuracy for four emotions, multimodal measurements (Electrocardiography, Electromyography and bio-signals) 79.3 \% for four emotive states, facial recognition 89 \% for seven states and speech recognition 80.46 \% for happiness and sadness. Looking forward, heart-related parameters might be an option to measure emotions accurately and unobtrusive with the help of smart wearables. This can be used in dynamic or outdoor tasks. Facial recognition on the other hand is a useful contact-less tool when it comes to emotion recognition during computer interaction.},

  abstract = {Background: People with intellectual disabilities have poor access to health care, which may be further compromised by a lack of accessible health information. To be effective, health information must be easily understood and remembered. People with intellectual disabilities learn better from multimodal information sources, and virtual reality offers a 3-dimensional (3D) computer-generated environment that can be used for providing information and learning. To date, research into virtual reality experiences for people with intellectual disabilities has been limited to skill-based training and leisure opportunities within the young to mid age ranges.
Objective: This study assessed the acceptability, usability, and potential utility of a virtual reality experience as a means of providing health care-related information to people with intellectual disabilities. We designed a prototype multimodal experience based on a hospital scenario and situated on an island in the Second Life 3D virtual world. We wanted to know how people of different ages and with varying levels of cognitive function would participate in the customized virtual environment, what they understood from being there, and what they remembered a week later.
Methods: The study drew on qualitative data. We used a participatory research approach that involved working alongside people with intellectual disabilities and their supporters in a community setting. Cognitive function was assessed, using the Matrix Analogies Test and the British Picture Vocabulary Scale, to describe the sample. Participants, supported by facilitators, were video recorded accessing and engaging with the virtual environment. We assessed recall 1 week later, using a specialized interview technique. Data were downloaded into NVivo 8 and analyzed using the framework analysis technique.
Results: Study participants were 20 people aged between 20 and 80 years with mild to severe intellectual disabilities. All participants were able to access the environment and voluntarily stayed there for between 23 and 57 minutes. With facilitator support, all participants moved the avatar themselves. Participants engaged with the scenario as if they were actually there, indicating cognitive presence. Some referred back to previous medical experiences, indicating the potential for experiential knowledge to become the foundation of new learning and retention of knowledge. When interviewed, all participants remembered some aspects of the environment.
Conclusions: A sample of adults with intellectual disabilities of all ages, and with varying levels of cognitive function, accessed and enjoyed a virtual-world environment that drew on a health care-related scenario, and remembered aspects of it a week later. The small sample size limits generalizability of findings, but the potential shown for experiential learning to aid retention of knowledge on which consent is based appears promising.

However, designing and developing of the AR courseware with these characteristics while ensuring the effectiveness in teaching and learning process can be quite challenging. The increasingly use of AR has called for the creation of more usable products of high quality, which in turn, makes the Usability Evaluation testing an essential process. Previous researchers stressed that until very recently, where the Usability Evaluation of AR interfaces had not been systematically examined. Furthermore, nowadays usability is a fundamental factor to consider when developing educational courseware. Therefore, a good design for the usability evaluation methodology is needed which is best suited for Down Syndrome (DS) learners in early reading. This paper describes the review of usability evaluation in learning courseware and presenting the usability evaluation that has been successfully applied to previous AR applications. Next, we will present several existing usability evaluation methods as a guideline in conducting the usability evaluation for AR BACA SindD. Lastly, this paper proposed a Design of Usability Evaluation Methodology Framework for AR BACA SindD, especially for the DS children in this case study. Hopefully, the methods that were used for the evaluation as well as the suitable usability evaluation methodology proposed, can be deployed to evaluate the effectiveness of the courseware to disabled children as general and primarily to the DS children.},
