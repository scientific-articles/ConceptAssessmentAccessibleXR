  abstract = {Objective: This paper aims to observe, in a real design project of a virtual reality-based software, how the various stakeholders (users, designers, project leaders) actually participate by sharing and pulling pieces of information from the process of needs elaboration, and how these contributions evolve throughout the decisions made in the course of the project.
Method: Our method, based on the observation of the practices in collective design, allows us to collect and analyze the relationship between each possible action (e.g., elicitation), each stakeholder who initiates these actions (e.g., users) and each phase of the design process (e.g., evaluation phase), and the dynamics of the construction of needs.
Results: Our results detail how the elicited needs are dealt with by designers, users and/or project leaders: (1) we show a strong contribution of users in the design, compared to others stakeholders, (2) among the needs elicited by users, most have been validated by the designers, (3) some elicited needs could have been firstly rejected and finally validated and implemented.
Conclusion: We identify the reasons which justify and explain our results confronting them to the literature. We underline the conditions have been satisfied in our study in order to involve effectively users in the design of emerging technologies.},

  abstract = {Virtual reality training systems are commonly used in a variety of domains, and it is important to understand how the realism of a training simulation influences training effectiveness. We conducted a controlled experiment to test the effects of display and scenario properties on training effectiveness for a visual scanning task in a simulated urban environment. The experiment varied the levels of field of view and visual complexity during a training phase and then evaluated scanning performance with the simulator's highest levels of fidelity and scene complexity. To assess scanning performance, we measured target detection and adherence to a prescribed strategy. The results show that both field of view and visual complexity significantly affected target detection during training; higher field of view led to better performance and higher visual complexity worsened performance. Additionally, adherence to the prescribed visual scanning strategy during assessment was best when the level of visual complexity during training matched that of the assessment conditions, providing evidence that similar visual complexity was important for learning the technique. The results also demonstrate that task performance during training was not always a sufficient measure of mastery of an instructed technique. That is, if learning a prescribed strategy or skill is the goal of a training exercise, performance in a simulation may not be an appropriate indicator of effectiveness outside of training\textemdash evaluation in a more realistic setting may be necessary.},

An experiment has been conducted to examine the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of learning achievements and motivations. The subjects were 57 fourth graders from two classes taught by the same teacher in an elementary school in northern Taiwan. The experimental results showed that the proposed approach is able to improve the students' learning achievements. Moreover, it was found that the students who learned with the augmented reality-based mobile learning approach showed significantly higher motivations in the attention, confidence, and relevance dimensions than those who learned with the conventional inquiry-based mobile learning approach.},

The author's VR/AR/MR learning systems/environments quality evaluation and personalisation framework is also presented in the paper. Evaluation of quality of VR/AR/MR platforms/environments should be based on (a) applying both expert-centred (top-down) and user-centred (bottom-up) quality evaluation methods and (b) separating `internal quality' criteria, and `quality in use' criteria in the set of quality criteria (model). Personalisation of VR/AR/MR platforms/environments should be based on learners' models/profiles using students' learning styles, intelligent technologies, and Semantic Web applications.},

This qualitative study aims at exploring young-elderly (aged 60--75) travellers as potential users and actual users of the Internet with mobile device during trips. The results identify a range of possible drivers and barriers for the use of Internet with mobile devices and their impact on the travel experience during trips. The study also suggests that there is a substantial number of young-elderly travellers that are quite advanced in their mobile usage behaviour.},

abstract = "Abstract The Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) wave and advancement in technical infrastructures and in learning technology opens for new ways of teaching in the classroom. The teachers' laptops connected to a video projector, access to wireless network and the students smartphones, tablets or laptops can be utilized to enhance the interaction between the teacher and students, as well as boost the students motivation, engagement and learning. The introduction of new learning technology in the classroom normally results in immediate enthusiasm and excitement both from the teacher and the students. However, the immediate positive effects might fade when the new learning technology has become familiar to the teacher and the students. This paper shows the results from investigating the wear off effect of using the game-based student response system Kahoot! in classroom teaching. More specifically, it compares the results from students using Kahoot! for the first time in a single motivational lecture vs. using Kahoot! in every lecture in a class for five months. The quasi-experiment focused on how the students' perception changed in relation to user-friendliness, engagement, motivation, classroom dynamics, concentration, and perceived learning. The results show a slight reduction in the students motivation and engagement, but the only statistically significant wear out effect found was related to classroom dynamics. At large, the game-based student response system managed to boost students engagement, motivation and learning after using it repeatedly for five months. The core factor to keep the students attention after heavy repeated usage was found to be the competitive nature of Kahoot!. "

abstract = "There are many examples on the use of game-based learning in and outside the classroom, along with evaluation of their effect in terms of engagement, learning, classroom dynamics, concentration, motivation and enjoyment. Most of the research in this area focuses on evaluations of the use of game-based learning applications and the effect they have on the students. The majority of these papers show that game-based learning has a positive effect compared to more traditional learning methods. However, there are very few papers that investigate what specific elements in game-based learning applications that produce a positive effect on engagement, motivation, enjoyment, concentration, classroom dynamics and learning. In this paper, we present an experiment where we investigated how the use of points and audio affect the learning environment. Specifically, the paper presents results from an experiment where the same lecture was taught for different group of students using the game-based learning platform Kahoot!. One group used Kahoot! as it supposed to be used with audio and points, one group use Kahoot! without points, and one group used Kahoot! without audio with points, and one group used Kahoot! without points and audio. The results from the experiment reveal that there are some significant differences whether audio and points are used in game-based learning in the areas of concentration, engagement, enjoyment, and motivation. The most surprising finding was how the classroom dynamics was positively affected by use of audio. A total of 593 students participated in this experiment with a gender distribution of 44{\%} female and 56 male students. Contribution: Factorial design method, lit review",

The scores are achieved by combining the results of an observational study with a supplementary expert evaluation for high reliability. The methodology was successfully applied with pupils in an informal-learning context at Oslo Science Center.

abstract="There is no doubt that an abundance of factors exists that makes learning with serious games successful. Research articles reporting on these factors, however, tend to focus on select serious game elements and do not combine all salient factors for successful learning with serious games. Addressing this gap is a necessity for the success of serious games and may even alleviate long-standing debates about pedagogy over enjoyment, how much realism is enough or whether artificial intelligence is worth the cost. This article examines existing academic literature from 2000 to 2015, extracting shared serious game success factors that have had an encouraging impact on gameful learning experiences. As such, we subsequently aim to withdraw the field from a perpetual spiral of does-my-game-work research toward more worthwhile why-does-my-game-not-work research. Qualitative content analysis through the constant comparison method (CCM) analyzed a total of 63 articles from a variety of recognized electronic libraries and databases. Through this analysis, we reveal five central serious game themes: backstory and production; realism; artificial intelligence and adaptivity; interaction; and feedback and debriefing, all of which require deliberate intertwining with pedagogical content to ensure successful learning. This review unravels each of the five themes into their constituent factors and consequently presents the factors as practical guidelines that serious games producers should strive to include in their game productions. Applying these recommendations whenever serious games are considered will provide a foundation for effective gameful learning experiences.",

	title = {Designing {Narrative} {Games} for a {Serious} {Context}},
	abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a new approach to designing games for serious contexts. In contrast to Serious Games we argue that learning is a too narrow focus for serious contexts and that simulation of real world problems ought to be supplemented with other design strategies that place greater emphasis on fiction and narratives. The approach is exemplified through three game prototypes designed to be played by an inmate and his child in a prison during visiting hours. By analyzing these game prototypes we demonstrate how a game can be structured around a narrative plot in three different ways. Moreover, we discuss how narrative plots in a game may open up for developing players emotional experiences over time and grow social relationships between inmate and child. On the basis of our case analysis we discuss, in more detail, how our approach differs from Serious Games and we single out some key implications for emotion-driven design.},

These approaches may arise from the inter-relationship of two dimensions of playing style: action versus interaction, and world-oriented versus player-oriented. An account of the dynamics of player populations is given in terms of these dimensions, with particular attention to how to promote balance or equilibrium. This analysis also offers an explanation for the labelling of MUDs as being either "social" or "gamelike".}},

The underlying model is based on research on human motivation, player types, and years of practical design experiences. This model presents the first typology to classify users of gamified systems, enabling clustering them based on intrinsic and extrinsic motivational factors. The HEXAD model is comprised of the following six gamification user types: Socializers, Free Spirits, Achievers, Philanthropists, Players, and Disruptors. We have developed a questionnaire to assess how a user is represented by the different gamification user types. The following paper will present the development process of the questionnaire. Application venues will be discussed.},

    abstract = {Investigated the question of whether any facial expressions of emotion are universal. Recent studies showing that members of literate cultures associated the same emotion concepts with the same facial behaviors could not demonstrate that at least some facial expressions of emotion are universal; the cultures compared had all been exposed to some of the same mass media presentations of facial expression, and these may have taught the people in each culture to recognize the unique facial expressions of other cultures. To show that members of a preliterate culture who had minimal exposure to literate cultures would associate the same emotion concepts with the same facial behaviors as do members of Western and Eastern literate cultures, data were gathered in New Guinea by telling 342 Ss a story, showing them a set of 3 faces, and asking them to select the face which showed the emotion appropriate to the story. Ss were members of the Fore linguistic-cultural group, which up until 12 yr. ago was an isolated, Neolithic, material culture. Results provide evidence in support of the hypothesis.},

  abstract = {{Recent neurological studies indicate that the role of emotion in human cognition is essential; emotions are not a luxury. Instead, emotions play a critical role in rational decision-making, in perception, in human interaction, and in human intelligence. These facts, combined with abilities computers are acquiring in expressing and recognizing affect, open new areas for research. This paper defines key issues in \&quot;affective computing, \&quot; computing that relates to, arises from, or deliberately influences emotions. New models are suggested for computer recognition of human emotion, and both theoretical and practical applications are described for learning, human-computer interaction, perceptual information retrieval, creative arts and entertainment, human health, and machine intelligence. Significant potential advances in emotion and cognition theory hinge on the development of affective computing, especially in the form of wearable computers. This paper establishes challenges and future directions for this emerging field}},

The main goal is to analyses learner facial expressions and show how Affective Computing could contribute for this interaction, being part of the complete student tracking (traceability) to monitor student behaviors during learning sessions. {\copyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

    abstract = {{At the heart of emotion, mood, and any other emotionally charged event are states experienced as simply feeling good or bad, energized or enervated. These states--called core affect--influence reflexes, perception, cognition, and behavior and are influenced by many causes internal and external, but people have no direct access to these causal connections. Core affect can therefore be experienced as free-floating (mood) or can be attributed to some cause (and thereby begin an emotional episode). These basic processes spawn a broad framework that includes perception of the core-affect-altering properties of stimuli, motives, empathy, emotional meta-experience, and affect versus emotion regulation; it accounts for prototypical emotional episodes, such as fear and anger, as core affect attributed to something plus various nonemotional processes.}},

Yet, advertising literature on how to measure emotions is not straightforward. The major aim of this article is to give an update on the different methods used for measuring emotions in advertising and to discuss their validity and applicability. We further draw conclusions on the relation between emotions and traditional measures of advertising effectiveness. We finally formulate recommendations on the use of the different methods and make suggestions for future research.},

However, the startle blink reflex, a widely employed measure of the emotional response, has not been considered to date. We decided to include two parameters of the startle reflex (magnitude and latency) in order to explore further how this response fits into the two-factor model of emotion. We recorded the acoustic startle blink response, skin conductance response, heart rate, free viewing time, and picture valence and arousal ratings of 45 subjects while viewing 54 pictures from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS; 18 unpleasant, 18 neutral, and 18 pleasant). Factorizations of all measures gave a two-factor solution (valence and arousal) that accounted for 70% of the variance. Although some measurements, including heart rate change, did not behave as predicted, our results reinforce the two-dimension model of the emotion, and show that startle fits into the model.},

    abstract = {{Electrodermal activity (EDA) is a sensitive index of sympathetic nervous system activity. Due to the lack of sensors that can be worn comfortably during normal daily activity and over extensive periods of time, research in this area is limited to laboratory settings or artificial clinical environments. We developed a novel, unobtrusive, nonstigmatizing, wrist-worn integrated sensor, and present, for the very first time, a demonstration of long-term, continuous assessment of EDA outside of a laboratory setting. We evaluated the performance of our device against a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved system for the measurement of EDA during physical, cognitive, as well as emotional stressors at both palmar and distal forearm sites, and found high correlations across all the tests. We also evaluated the choice of electrode material by comparing conductive fabric with Ag/AgCl electrodes and discuss the limitations found. An important result presented in this paper is evidence that the distal forearm is a viable alternative to the traditional palmar sites for EDA measurements. Our device offers the unprecedented ability to perform comfortable, long-term, and}},

The authors present the simple but radical idea that problems in life often arise from issues of communication, rather than from deep psychological disorders, reinforcing their conceptual explorations with case studies and well-known literary examples. Written with humor and for a variety of readers, this book identifies simple properties and axioms of human communication and demonstrates how all communications are actually a function of their contexts. Topics covered in this wide-ranging book include: the origins of communication; the idea that all behavior is communication; meta-communication; the properties of an open system; the family as a system of communication; the nature of paradox in psychotherapy; existentialism and human communication.},

When we are talking to someone who is depressed it may make us feel depressed, whereas if we talk to someone who is feeling self-confident and buoyant we are likely to feel good about ourselves. This phenomenon, known as emotional contagion, is identified here, and compelling evidence for its effects is offered from a variety of disciplines--social and developmental psychology, history, cross-cultural psychology, experimental psychology, and psychopathology. The authors propose a simple mechanism to account for the process of contagion. They argue that people, in their everyday encounters, tend automatically and continuously to synchronize with the facial expressions, voices, postures, movements, and instrumental emotional behaviors of others. Emotional experiences are affected, moment-to-moment, by the feedback from such mimicry. In a series of orderly chapters, the authors provide observational and laboratory evidence to support their propositions. They then offer practical suggestions for clinical psychologists, physicians, husbands and wives, parents, and professionals who wish to become better at shaping the emotional tone of social encounters.},

    abstract = {Video summarisation techniques aim to abstract the most significant content from a video stream. This is typically achieved by processing low-level image, audio and text features which are still quite disparate from the high-level semantics that end users identify with (the 'semantic gap'). Physiological responses are potentially rich indicators of memorable or emotionally engaging video content for a given user. Consequently, we investigate whether they may serve as a suitable basis for a video summarisation technique by analysing a range of user physiological response measures, specifically electro-dermal response ({EDR}), respiration amplitude ({RA}), respiration rate ({RR}), blood volume pulse ({BVP}) and heart rate ({HR}), in response to a range of video content in a variety of genres including horror, comedy, drama, sci-fi and action. We present an analysis framework for processing the user responses to specific sub-segments within a video stream based on percent rank value normalisation. The application of the analysis framework reveals that users respond significantly to the most entertaining video sub-segments in a range of content domains. Specifically, horror content seems to elicit significant {EDR}, {RA}, {RR} and {BVP} responses, and comedy content elicits comparatively lower levels of {EDR}, but does seem to elicit significant {RA}, {RR}, {BVP} and {HR} responses. Drama content seems to elicit less significant physiological responses in general, and both sci-fi and action content seem to elicit significant {EDR} responses. We discuss the implications this may have for future affective video summarisation approaches.},

    abstract = {Abstract Researchers interested in emotion have long struggled with the problem of how to elicit emotional responses in the laboratory. In this article, we summarise five years of work to develop a set of films that reliably elicit each of eight emotional states (amusement, anger, contentment, disgust, fear, neutral, sadness, and surprise). After evaluating over 250 films, we showed selected film clips to an ethnically diverse sample of 494 English-speaking subjects. We then chose the two best films for each of the eight target emotions based on the intensity and discreteness of subjects' responses to each film. We found that our set of 16 films successfully elicited amusement, anger, contentment. disgust, sadness, surprise, a relatively neutral state, and, to a lesser extent, fear. We compare this set of films with another set recently described by Philippot (1993), and indicate that detailed instructions for creating our set of film stimuli will be provided on request.},

  abstract = {Assessing gameplay experience for gaze interaction games is a challenging task. For this study, a gaze interaction Half-Life 2 game modification was created that allowed eye tracking control. The mod was deployed during an experiment at Dreamhack 2007, where participants had to play with gaze navigation and afterwards rate their gameplay experience. The results show low tension and negative affects scores on the gameplay experience questionnaire as well as high positive challenge, immersion and flow ratings. The correlation between spatial presence and immersion for gaze interaction was high and yields further investigation. It is concluded that gameplay experience can be correctly assessed with the methodology presented in this paper.},

  abstract = {Scalable video is an attractive option for adapting the bandwidth consumption of streaming video to the available bandwidth. Fine-grained scalability can adapt most closely to the available bandwidth, but this comes at the cost of a high compression penalty. In the context of VoD streaming to mobile end systems, we have therefore explored whether a similar adaptation to the available bandwidth can be achieved by performing layer switching in coarse-grained scalable videos. In this approach, enhancement layers of a video stream are switched on and off to achieve any desired longer-term bandwidth. We performed user studies to evaluate the idea, and came to the far-from-obvious conclusion that layer switching is viable way for bit-rate savings and fine-grained bit-rate adaptation even for rather short times between layer switches.},

The monograph aims to describe a technique rather than to give results. The appendix, covering ten pages, shows the method of constructing an attitude scale. A bibliography is also given.}},

    abstract = {This paper presents an active noise cancellation method using a {MEMS} accelerometer that recovers wearable sensor signals corrupted by body motion. The method is developed for a finger ring photoplethysmograph ({PPG}) sensor, the signal of which is susceptive to the hand motion of the wearer. A {MEMS} accelerometer ({ACC}) imbedded in the {PPG} sensor detects the hand acceleration, and is used for recovering the corrupted {PPG} signal, based upon two different methods of modeling the process of signal corruption. The correlation between the acceleration and the distorted {PPG} signal is analyzed, and a low-order {FIR} model relating the signal distortion to the hand acceleration is obtained. The model parameters are identified in real time with a recursive least square method. Experiments show that the active noise cancellation method can recover ring {PPG} sensor signals corrupted with {2G} of acceleration in the longitudinal direction of the digital artery.},

    abstract = {Reliable signals are the basic prerequisite for most mobile ECG monitoring applications. Especially when signals are analyzed automatically, capable motion artifact detection algorithms are of great importance. This article presents different artifact detection algorithms for ECG systems with dry electrodes. The algorithms are based on the measurement of additional parameters that are correlated with the artifacts. We describe a mobile measurement system and the procedure used for the evaluation of these algorithms. The algorithms are assessed based upon their effect on QRS detection. The best algorithm improved sensitivity (Se) from 98.7\% to 99.8\% and positive predictive value (+P) from 98.3\% to 99.9\%, while 15\% of the signal was marked as artifact. This corresponds to a decrease in false positive and false negative detected beats by 89.9\%. Different metrics to evaluate the performance of an artifact detection algorithm are presented.},

	xxxabstract={O ritmo frenético de vida na nossa sociedade motiva o design de sistemas que ajudem pessoas a lidar com stress. Existe, neste momento, uma série de aplicações que utilizam biosensores para medir dados fisiológicos associados com stress. No entanto, a grande maioria serve apenas para propósitos de diagnóstico, não permitem mobilidade e muitas vezes ignoram o contexto onde a pessoa se insere. A presente tese insere-se num projecto chamado Affective Health que é constituído por uma aplicação para telemóvel e uma rede de biosensores no corpo. Este sistema foi desenhado para permitir  uma ligação entre dados fisiológicos e as memórias e experiência subjectiva dos utilizadores, no decorrer do dia-a-dia. Para facilitar essa ligação, propomos uma representação dos dados fisiológicos mapeada em três conceitos: a actividade física, excitação e adaptabilidade.
Por ser destinado a uso contínuo no dia-a-dia, o sistema coloca desafios na aquisição de dados fisiológicos. Existe uma variada gama de sensores que se diferenciam pelo grau de precisão na captação do sinal e desconforto causado ao utilizador. 
Esta tese contribui com uma análise exploratória dos sensores e das características de biosinais que podem ser captados e analisados durante o curso da vida quotidiana. É mostrado que excitação e actividade física podem ser medidos consistentemente mas adaptabilidade pode apenas ser estimada indirectamente pela avaliação da qualidade do sono. Além disso, como ?proof-of-concept?, uma configuração de sensores é proposta satisfazendo requisitos de mobilidade.},

    abstract = {Quality of Service ({QoS}) and Quality of Experience ({QoE}) have to be considered when designing, building and maintaining services involving multimodal human-machine interaction. In order to guide the assessment and evaluation of such services, we first develop a taxonomy of the most relevant {QoS} and {QoE} aspects which result from multimodal human-machine interactions. It consists of three layers: (1) The quality factors influencing {QoS} and {QoE} related to the user, the system, and the context of use; (2) the {QoS} interaction performance aspects describing user and system behavior and performance; and (3) the {QoE} aspects related to the quality perception and judgment processes taking place within the user. For each of these layers, we then provide metrics which are able to capture the {QoS} and {QoE} aspects in a quantitative way, either via questionnaires or performance measures. The metrics are meant to guide system evaluation and make it more systematic and comparable.},

To evaluate how well the rate-allocation algorithms approach the optimum, we have earlier built a benchmarking system that provides the optimal solution for assigning available bandwidth to delivery paths. This solution is also proportionally-fair. We implement a distributed algorithm for multipath rate allocation that operates based on information collected by overlay nodes. The algorithm is evaluated in the OMNet++ simulation environment and analyzed against the aforementioned benchmarking.",

abstract="Modern patient monitoring systems are designed to put the individual into the centre of the system architecture. In this paradigm, the patient is seen as a source of health-relevant data that are processed and transferred. Patient monitoring systems are used in health care enterprises as well as in paramedic, mobile, and home situations to foster ambient assisted living (AAL) scenarios. There are a multitude of standards and products available to support Quality of Service (QoS) and security goals in patient monitoring systems. Yet, an architecture that supports these goals from data aggregation to data transmission and visualisation for end user has not been developed. Medical data from patient monitoring systems includes sampled values from measurements, sound, images, and video. These data often have a time-aspect where several data streams need to be synchronised. Therefore, rendering data from patient monitoring systems can be considered an advanced form of multimedia data. We propose a framework that will fill this QoS and security gap and provide a solution that allows medical personnel better access to data and more mobility to the patients. The framework is based on MPEG-21 and wireless sensor networks. It allows for end-to-end optimisation and presentation of multimedia sensor data. The framework also addresses the QoS, adaptation and security concerns of handling this data. In Section 2 we present background on patient monitoring systems, their requirements and how we envision communication is handled. We present communication systems in Section 3 and how to treat QoS in Section 4. A short introduction to data streaming, binary XML and how they relate to patient monitoring systems is presented in Section 5. In Section 6 we our proposed solution for the framework and present a security analysis of it in Section 7. Finally, we offer our conclusions in Section 8.",

This authentication method is the only method with mandatory support and widespread adoption in the industry. At the same time, this authentication method is vulnerable to a serious real-world attack. This poses a threat to VoIP industry installations and solutions. In this paper, we propose a solution that counters attacks on this wide-spread authentication method. We also propose a two-step migration towards a stronger authentication in SIP. We add support for a Password Authenticated Key Exchange algorithm that can function as a drop-in replacement for the widely adopted Digest Access Authentication mechanism. This new authentication mechanism adds support for mutual authentication, is considered stronger and can rely on the same shared password used by the digest authentication. A long-term solution is to replace the authentication scheme in SIP with a security abstraction layer. Two such security frameworks are introduced, discussed and evaluated: the Generic Security Services Application Program Interface and the Simple Authentication and Security Layer, which both enable SIP to transparently support and use more secure authentication methods in a unified and generic way.",

    abstract = {In this paper, we propose to provide a better way to monitor one's cardiac health status given today's array of exercise monitors. Built on top of our existing {MobiCare} technology and using an adaptation of the Fox and Haskell formula for exercise, we have set up an exercise monitor on the mobile phone that will help an individual achieve a certain goal that he or she wants from doing exercise. It could be something simple like better overall cardio fitness or something much more like losing weight. Once the goals and personal information are set for the individual, our exercise monitor program will advise users to achieve the maximal benefits of their exercise without going beyond their own limits. This will be beneficial to people who already have some difficulties to begin their exercise regime. This sports exercise monitor program will help them to gradually increase their duration and adaptation on physical activities and ultimately their general overall fitness.},

We explore the different meanings of trust and strategies that can be used to determine if something is trustworthy and propose a model for trust that takes into account people, devices, and their connections. The model uses {\`a} priori and {\`a} posteriori trust to give an indication of how much a user can trust or distrust the information provided by things. This trust indicator can inform users' decisions on whether or not to use a device or service.",

abstract = {End-users on the Internet of Things (IoT) will encounter many different devices and services; they will need to decide whether or not they can trust these devices and services with their information. We identify three items of trust information that end-users will need to determine if they should trust something on the IoT. We create a taxonomy of the likely scenarios end-users will encounter on the IoT and present five trust strategies for obtaining this trust information. Upon applying these strategies to our scenarios, we find that there is no strategy that can work efficiently and effectively in every situations; end-users will need to apply the strategy that best fits their current situation. Offering multiple trust strategies in parallel and having this information transparent to end-users will ensure a sustainable IoT.},

abstract = {Personas can help raise awareness among stakeholders about users' needs. While personas are made-up people, they are based on facts gathered from user research. Personas can also be used to raise awareness of universal design and accessibility needs of people with disabilities. We review the current state of the art of the personas and review some research and industry projects that use them. We outline techniques that can be used to create personas with disabilities. This includes advice on how to get more information about assistive technology and how to better include people with disabilities in the persona creation process. We also describe our use of personas with disabilities in several projects and discuss how it has helped to find accessibility issues.},

abstract="The article argues for a shift of perspective in identity management (IDM) research and development. Accessibility and usability issues affect identity management to such an extent that they demand a reframing and reformulation of basic designs and requirements of modern identity management systems. The rationale for the traditional design of identity management systems and mechanisms has been security concerns as defined in the field of security engineering. By default the highest security level has been recommended and implemented, often without taking end-user needs and accessibility issues into serious consideration. The article provides a conceptual framework for inclusive IDM, a brief overview of the regulatory status of inclusive IDM and a taxonomy of inclusive identity management methods. Several widespread IDM approaches, methods and techniques are analyzed and discussed from the perspective of inclusive design. Several important challenges are identified and some ideas for solutions addressing the challenges are proposed and discussed.",

@article{allen-2004,
    abstract = {{Science museum staff face a constructivist dilemma as they design their public spaces: the exhibits should facilitate science learning, yet they also need to support a diverse visiting public in making their own personal choices about where to attend, what to do, and how to interpret their interactions. To be effective as teaching tools, exhibits need to be highly intrinsically motivating at every step of an interaction in order to sustain involvement by an audience who views their visit primarily as a leisure activity. Given these challenges, it is vital to support the design process with a strong program of research and evaluation. I give a personal perspective on one institution's research and evaluation work over the last decade, focusing on four areas: immediate apprehendability, physical interactivity, conceptual coherence, and diversity of learners. {\copyright} 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

        abstract = {Previous research into the quantification of embodied intellectual and emotional engagement using non-verbal movement parameters has not yielded consistent results across different studies. Our research introduces NIMI (Non-Instrumental Movement Inhibition) as an alternative parameter. We propose that the absence of certain types of possible movements can be a more holistic proxy for cognitive engagement with media (in seated persons) than searching for the presence of other movements. Rather than analyzing total movement as an indicator of engagement, our research team distinguishes between instrumental movements (i.e. physical movement serving a direct purpose in the given situation) and non-instrumental movements, and investigates them in the context of the narrative rhythm of the stimulus. We demonstrate that NIMI occurs by showing viewers? movement levels entrained (i.e. synchronised) to the repeating narrative rhythm of a timed computer-presented quiz. Finally, we discuss the role of objective metrics of engagement in future context-aware analysis of human behaviour in audience research, interactive media and responsive system and interface design.}

Search terms identified 129 papers reporting empirical evidence about the impacts and outcomes of computer games and serious games with respect to learning and engagement and a multidimensional approach to categorizing games was developed. The findings revealed that playing computer games is linked to a range of perceptual, cognitive, behavioural, affective and motivational impacts and outcomes. The most frequently occurring outcomes and impacts were knowledge acquisition/content understanding and affective and motivational outcomes. The range of indicators and measures used in the included papers are discussed, together with methodological limitations and recommendations for further work in this area. "

abstract = {Abstract The claim that selves are narratively constituted has attained considerable currency in both analytic and continental philosophy. However, a set of increasingly standard objections to narrative identity are also emerging. In this paper, I focus on metaphysically realist versions of narrative identity theory, showing how they both build on and differ from their neo-Lockean counterparts. But I also argue that narrative realism is implicitly committed to a four-dimensionalist, temporal-parts ontology of persons. That exposes narrative realism to the charge that the narratively constituted self, on the one hand, and the self that is the object of much of our everyday self-reference and self-experience, on the other, can't be the same thing. This conclusion may well force narrativists to abandon metaphysical realism about narrative selveswhich, in turn, may leave the invocation of narrativity as identity-constituting somewhat under-motivated.}

  abstract = {Currently, new technologies have enabled the design of smart applications that are used as decision-making tools in the problems of daily life. The key issue in designing such an application is the increasing level of user interaction. Mixed reality (MR) is an emerging technology that deals with maximum user interaction in the real world compared to other similar technologies. Developing an MR application is complicated, and depends on the different components that have been addressed in previous literature. In addition to the extraction of such components, a comprehensive study that presents a generic framework comprising all components required to develop MR applications needs to be performed. This review studies intensive research to obtain a comprehensive framework for MR applications. The suggested framework comprises five layers: the first layer considers system components; the second and third layers focus on architectural issues for component integration; the fourth layer is the application layer that executes the architecture; and the fifth layer is the user interface layer that enables user interaction. The merits of this study are as follows: this review can act as a proper resource for MR basic concepts, and it introduces MR development steps and analytical models, a simulation toolkit, system types, and architecture types, in addition to practical issues for stakeholders such as considering MR different domains.},

By its very nature, MR is a highly interdisciplinary field engaging signal processing, computer vision, computer graphics, user interfaces, human factors, wearable computing, mobile computing, information visualization, and the design of displays and sensors. This chapter presents potential MR applications, technical challenges in realizing MR systems, as well as issues related to usability and collaboration in MR.

The need to demonstrate accountability and social value has led to a demand to measure the impact and outcome of learning. How can the complex and unpredictable character of learning be ‘measured’? This paper sets out the policy context and the conceptual framework that underpins the development of a new approach to the measurement of the outcomes of cultural learning. It has been developed by the Research Centre for Museums and Galleries (RCMG) at the University of Leicester for the Museums, Archives and Libraries Council (formerly Resource). The use of five generic learning outcomes (GLOs) enables both the quantification and the in‐depth ­analysis and description of the results of learning. }

abstract = { The concept of school engagement has attracted increasing attention as representing a possible antidote to declining academic motivation and achievement. Engagement is presumed to be malleable, responsive to contextual features, and amenable to environmental change. Researchers describe behavioral, emotional, and cognitive engagement and recommend studying engagement as a multifaceted construct. This article reviews definitions, measures, precursors, and outcomes of engagement; discusses limitations in the existing research; and suggests improvements. The authors conclude that, although much has been learned, the potential contribution of the concept of school engagement to research on student experience has yet to be realized. They call for richer characterizations of how students behave, feel, and think—research that could aid in the development of finely tuned interventions }
