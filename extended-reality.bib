We created Canetroller, a haptic cane controller that simulates white cane interactions, enabling people with visual impairments to navigate a virtual environment by transferring their cane skills into the virtual world. Canetroller provides three types of feedback: (1) physical resistance generated by a wearable programmable brake mechanism that physically impedes the controller when the virtual cane comes in contact with a virtual object; (2) vibrotactile feedback that simulates the vibrations when a cane hits an object or touches and drags across various surfaces; and (3) spatial 3D auditory feedback simulating the sound of real-world cane interactions. We designed indoor and outdoor VR scenes to evaluate the effectiveness of our controller. Our study showed that Canetroller was a promising tool that enabled visually impaired participants to navigate different virtual spaces. We discuss potential applications supported by Canetroller ranging from entertainment to mobility training.},

The system also allows the therapist to monitor and interact with patients remotely providing reinforcing feedback and support with the CollaboRhythm care delivery platform. The data collected with this system enables the therapist and the patient to make informed decisions about patient treatment and exercise regimens based on the patient progress. The system is capable of supporting a wide array of rehabilitation scenarios with remote collaboration. A knee replacement scenario was tested with an experimental protocol involving 16 healthy participants. The results show both quantitatively and qualitatively that patients can learn intuitively to perform their physical therapy exercises on a remote environment without further human intervention.},

Self-criticism is a ubiquitous feature of psychopathology and can be treated by increasing levels of self-compassion. We exploited the known effects of identification with a virtual body to arrange for healthy female volunteers high in self-criticism to experience self-compassion from an embodied first-person perspective within immersive virtual reality. Whereas observation and practice of compassionate responses reduced self-criticism, the additional experience of embodiment also increased self-compassion and feelings of being safe. The results suggest potential new uses for immersive virtual reality in a range of clinical conditions.},

Additionally such virtual embodiment can lead to changes in perception, implicit attitudes and behaviour based on attributes of the VB. To date the changes that have been studied are as a result of being embodied in a body representative of particular social groups (e.g., children and other race). In our experiment participants alternately switched between a VB closely resembling themselves where they described a personal problem and a VB representing Dr Sigmund Freud, from which they offered themselves counselling. Here we show that when the counsellor resembles Freud participants improve their mood, compared to the counsellor being a self-representation. The improvement was greater when the Freud VB moved synchronously with the participant, compared to asynchronously. Synchronous VB movement was associated with a much stronger illusion of ownership over the Freud body. This suggests that this form of embodied perspective taking can lead to sufficient detachment from habitual ways of thinking about personal problems, so as to improve the outcome and demonstrates the power of virtual body ownership to effect cognitive changes.},

A portable electronic prototype that allows blind people to receive spatial information of their surroundings has been developed. This information is perceived via an audible image using Head Related Transfer Function (HRTFs) processed sounds. The main goal is to create for the user the illusion that the surrounding objects are covered by small sound continuously emitting sources in a particular and sustained way. Therefore, a virtual acoustic world is generated, where a physical object emit sounds from all the coordinates of its surface. Our results validate the hypothesis that, it is possible to generate an experience of global and sustained presence of different objects inside the perception field from these stimuli, with the same shape, dimensions and location as the real environment. Our objectives are now focused on: a better delimitation of the observed capabilities, the study of the developed prototype in everyday life conditions, on exploring how blind people learn to use new strategies to improve their perception of the environment and the exploration of the possible cortical brain areas involved in this process, using functional imaging techniques},

  abstract = {Navigation within a closed environment requires analysis of a variety of acoustic cues, a task that is well developed in many visually impaired individuals, and for which sighted individuals rely almost entirely on visual information. For blind people, the act of creating cognitive maps for spaces, such as home or office buildings, can be a long process, for which the individual may repeat various paths numerous times. While this action is typically performed by the individual on-site, it is of some interest to investigate at which point this task can be performed off-site, at the individual's discretion. In short, is it possible for an individual to learn an architectural environment without being physically present? If so, such a system could prove beneficial for navigation preparation in new and unknown environments. The main goal of the present research can therefore be summarized as investigating the possibilities of assisting blind individuals in learning a spatial environment configuration through the listening of audio events and their interactions with these events within a virtual reality experience. A comparison of two types of learning through auditory exploration has been performed: in situ real displacement and active navigation in a virtual architecture. The virtual navigation rendered only acoustic information. Results for two groups of five participants showed that interactive exploration of virtual acoustic room simulations can provide sufficient information for the construction of coherent spatial mental maps, although some variations were found between the two environments tested in the experiments. Furthermore, the mental representation of the virtually navigated environments preserved topological and metric properties, as was found through actual navigation.},

  abstract   = {Virtual worlds and environments are becoming an increasingly central part of our lives, yet they are still far from accessible to the blind. This is especially unfortunate as such environments hold great potential for them for uses such as social interaction, online education and especially for use with familiarizing the visually impaired user with a real environment virtually from the comfort and safety of his own home before visiting it in the real world. We have implemented a simple algorithm to improve this situation using single-point depth information, enabling the blind to use a virtual cane, modeled on the “EyeCane” electronic travel aid, within any virtual environment with minimal pre-processing. Use of the Virtual-EyeCane, enables this experience to potentially be later used in real world environments with identical stimuli to those from the virtual environment. We show the fast-learned practical use of this algorithm for navigation in simple environments.},

In all the experiments differences in perception by blind and sighted people were also explored. The results have implications for the future design of VEs in that it cannot be assumed that virtual textures and objects will feel to the user as the designer intends.

  abstract  = {For comprehensively participating in society, independent and safe mobility is an important skill for many daily activities. Spatial cognition is one of the most important human capabilities and addresses the acquisition, processing and utilization of knowledge about the spatial layout of environments. Humans predominantly use the visual sense for this and for blind and low vision people, the lack of spatial perception reduces their quality of life and their ability of independent living. In particular the spatial navigation in unknown environments imposes challenges, since there is no possibility to train navigation tasks in advance. Today, blind and visually impaired people still rely on traditional navigation aids such as a cane for micro-navigation, which - however - does not help for developing orientation at larger scale or for planning of routes. To overcome this problem, this paper introduces the concept of a virtual environment that allows experiencing unknown locations by real walking while still staying in a sage controlled environment. Since this virtual environment can be controlled in its complexity, it can be adjusted from an abstract training scenario to a real-life situation such as train stations or airports.},

A visual feedback of the scene is also provided to enable sighted people to follow the navigation of the main user.

It explores the use of VR through smartphones to practically apply gradual exposure to environment stressors that are typically found in busy spaces from one’s own safe environment. Design/methodology/approach Aberdeen International Airport has kindly accepted to take part to this research as a case study. Following a participatory design and usability testing, a semi-controlled seven-day study was conducted among seven individuals with hidden disabilities to assess user acceptance. Findings Results showed undeniable participants’ engagement and enthusiasm for the proposed approach, although further research is needed to increase the presence and improve the overall user experience. Research limitations/implications The proposed research has been conducted on small cohort of participants outside of a clinical setting. Further engagement with individuals with hidden disabilities is required in order to determine the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Originality/value This research presents a methodological and technological framework which contributes effectively to the practicality of VR exposure therapy outside of the laboratory setting, from one’s own safe place.},

We suggest an intuitive planning interface where exercise managers can use block-based programming to create machine-readable training vignettes. An answer set programming module interprets these vignettes and generates all possible actions and causal relations, which are then visualised for the exercise manager in a sunburst diagram. This allows exercise managers to create training vignettes using visual techniques and to see the possible results and causal relations of the trainees' actions. This facilitates using exercise results to adjust further vignette design.",

abstract = { Virtual reality (VR) possesses many qualities that give it rehabilitative potential for people with intellectual disabilities, both as an intervention and an assessment. It can provide a safe setting in which to practice skills that might carry too many risks in the real world. Unlike human tutors, computers are infinitely patient and consistent. Virtual worlds can be manipulated in ways the real world cannot be and can convey concepts without the use of language or other symbol systems. Published applications for this client group have all been as rehabilitative interventions. These are described in three groups: promoting skills for independent living, enhancing cognitive performance, and improving social skills. Five groups of studies are reviewed that utilize virtual technology to promote skills for independent living: grocery shopping, preparing food, orientation, road safety, and manufacturing skills. Fears that skills or habits learnt in a virtual setting would not transfer to the real world setting have not been supported by the available evidence, apart from those studies with people with autistic spectrum disorders. Future directions are in the development of more applications for independent living skills, exploring interventions for promoting motor and cognitive skills, and the developments of ecologically valid forms of assessment. }

Working through these issues involves reconciling disability studies with e-learning and accessibility perspectives. It is proposed that strategies that would support this reconciliation might be found in recent literature on disability and technology. },

abstract = "Navigation within a closed environment requires analysis of a variety of acoustic cues, a task that is well developed in many visually impaired individuals, and for which sighted individuals rely almost entirely on visual information. For blind people, the act of creating cognitive maps for spaces, such as home or office buildings, can be a long process, for which the individual may repeat various paths numerous times. While this action is typically performed by the individual on-site, it is of some interest to investigate at which point this task can be performed off-site, at the individual's discretion. In short, is it possible for an individual to learn an architectural environment without being physically present? If so, such a system could prove beneficial for navigation preparation in new and unknown environments. The main goal of the present research can therefore be summarized as investigating the possibilities of assisting blind individuals in learning a spatial environment configuration through the listening of audio events and their interactions with these events within a virtual reality experience. A comparison of two types of learning through auditory exploration has been performed: in situ real displacement and active navigation in a virtual architecture. The virtual navigation rendered only acoustic information. Results for two groups of five participants showed that interactive exploration of virtual acoustic room simulations can provide sufficient information for the construction of coherent spatial mental maps, although some variations were found between the two environments tested in the experiments. Furthermore, the mental representation of the virtually navigated environments preserved topological and metric properties, as was found through actual navigation."

abstract="User participatory design is considered to be one of the best methods for understanding the needs of a target audience and creating high quality, well designed solutions to meet their needs. For many design students, the principles of participatory design in the creation of new user experiences are part of their curriculum. However, the involvement of disabled persons into the user experience design (UXD) process can be difficult in an educational setting. Often persons with autism and cognitive disabilities are excluded from user experience data collection due to their lack of sufficient cognitive ability and language skills to participate in these research methods in meaningful ways. Further, educators may shy away from involving this group due to institutional regulations and ethical concerns. This paper presents a case study introducing design students to inclusive UXD strategies and observing autistic children, using an approach called the ``Connectivity Model''. The model avoids the requirement for complex ethical clearance by facilitating observations via recorded videos. We present outcomes and evaluate the model against the most pertinent needs of these children.",

ABSTRACT={To answer the question about which e-health and e-therapy applications are being used with people with intellectual disabilities, we searched the PsycINFO, Medline, PubMed, ERIC, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases. This is an extensive search. Inclusion criteria were academic journals and any design type that addressed the topic of interest. Studies that do not include adults or elderly, and studies that do not focus on people with disabilities but on third parties, were excluded. After an initial selection of 515 articles, 32 full-text articles were subjected to in-depth analysis leading to the final selection of 18 articles. We used the AAID framework definition of intellectual disability to analyze the dimensions explored by the selected studies and found that the majority of studies focused on the use of technology as supports to instrumental activities of daily life. The ISO classification of assistive products allowed us to identify that many e-health products are aimed at providing psychological or medical treatment. In summary, this review suggests that there is a very small number of studies focusing on the use of technology by older persons with intellectual disabilities. The studies present substantial limitations regarding generalization and replication and pay little attention to the maintenance of cognitive abilities in this population. These aspects, together with premature aging generally associated with many conditions that lead to intellectual disability, underscore the need to pay more attention to and develop e-health interventions for cognitive stimulation for this group.}

AIM: The aim of this study is to examine the contribution of e-services in terms of how they diminish barriers and constraints on social inclusion. METHOD: A literature review was performed, covering the period between 2010 and 2016 (6~years). Only studies that discussed the social inclusion of people with disabilities or presented prototype solutions to this problem were included. RESULTS: The results of this study show that there is a lack of theoretical framework which can be used to measure the effectiveness of the e-services or innovations in the area of e-services in the contexts that were examined. The existing research studies are normally generic and do not discuss whether the requirements that are imposed on a particular e-service differ depending on (i) type of disability, (ii) the ICT-maturity or skill of the end-user, or (iii) context in which the e-service will be used. In general, previous research in this area claims that e-services do assist people with disabilities access to society (defined as the community in which they live), even when no evidence is actually presented about the impact such services have in this area of the end-user's life. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study present us with new knowledge about the types of ICT-based innovations and e-services that have been proposed to facilitate the social integration of people with disabilities.},

   abstract = {The main goal of this thesis is to contribute to telepresence research by investigating a sightseeing experience in a virtual environment (VE) and by discussing insights from theories of telepresence, perception, experience of place, marketing and philosophy. The empirical work concerns a sightseeing experience, a visit to a city in a videogame (the VE). In the literature review I discuss the Spinozian unity hypothesis and rapid acceptance response; a one-step mental process that states that acceptance automatically follows comprehension. Theoretically, and in order understand why a user in a VE has the feeling of being there, I build on Merleau-Ponty’s theory of perception and Heidegger’s ready-to-hand concept. Merleau-Ponty provides a compelling account of the role of the body, the senses and embodiment in perception. In telepresence research, Riva (2008) postulates, with reference to Heidegger, that the medium is ready-to-hand. My conclusion is similar; when someone has a feeling of being there, this is due to the fact that the medium is transparent to them. When this is not the case, the user will (or may) experience breaks in presence. I review a number of telepresence measurements, primarily questionnaires. I chose the Temple Presence Inventory, a measurement that includes perceptual realism that involves the senses. I argue that there are alternatives to the measurements developed by telepresence researchers to study the feeling of being there. To test this claim, I included two alternatives in my empirical studies, one from human geography based on Edward Relph’s sense of place theory and one from consumer behavior. I developed evaluative statements for someone visiting a city. I also developed a 3-item scale to assess the experienced affordances provided by the VE. These three factors identify participants’ behavioral intentions. The first empirical study featured the city of Las Vegas in the video game Project Gotham Racing 4. The second featured Los Angeles in Midnight Club Los Angeles. I used PLS path modeling to analyze the empirical results and shed light on the relationship between the telepresence concept, an experience of place concept, and a hedonic consumption concept. I analyzed the ability of these concepts to predict affordance (in a VE) and behavioral intention. The findings from the studies reveal differences that contribute to the discussion of what the feeling of being there is in different situations and contexts. I conclude, based on these findings, that for many of the participants, the individuals that “visited the city on the screen” really did have the feeling of being there in the moment. },

Firstly, a reflection on the state of art of AR applications in industries is proposed, to discover the sectors more commonly chosen for deploying the technology so far. Later, based on a survey conducted after that, three AR applications have been tested on manufacturing, automotive, and railway sectors, and the paper pinpoints key aspects that are conditioning its embedding in the daily working life. In order to compare whether the perception of employees from railway, automotive, and manufacturing sectors differs significantly, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) has been used. Later, suggestions are formulated in order to improve these aspects in the industry world. Finally, the paper indicates the main conclusions, highlighting possible future researches to start.},

In this article we present our literature review of virtual reality and the Cave Automated Virtual Environment (CAVE). In particular, the article begins by providing a brief overview of the evolution of virtual reality. In addition, key elements of a virtual reality system are presented along with a proposed taxonomy that categorizes such systems from the perspective of technologies used and the mental immersion level found in these systems. Moreover, a detailed overview of the CAVE is presented in terms of its characteristics, uses, and mainly, the interaction styles inside it. Insights of the interaction challenges and research directions of investigating interaction with virtual reality systems in general and the CAVE in particular are thoroughly discussed as well."

The system is applicable for any room shape (normal, long, flat, coupled), independent of the a priori assumption of a diffuse sound field. This provides the possibility of simulating indoor or outdoor spatially distributed, freely movable sources and a moving listener in virtual environments. In addition to that, near-to-head sources can be simulated by using measured near-field HRTFs. The reproduction component consists of a headphone-free reproduction by dynamic crosstalk cancellation. The focus of the project is mainly on the integration and interaction of all involved subsystems. It is demonstrated that the system is capable of real-time room simulation and reproduction and, thus, can be used as a reliable platform for further research on VR applications.},

abstract = {This article presents the results of a study that explored the human side of the multimedia experience. We propose a model that assesses quality variation from three distinct levels: the network, the media and the content levels; and from two views: the technical and the user perspective. By facilitating parameter variation at each of the quality levels and from each of the perspectives, we were able to examine their impact on user quality perception. Results show that a significant reduction in frame rate does not proportionally reduce the user's understanding of the presentation independent of technical parameters, that multimedia content type significantly impacts user information assimilation, user level of enjoyment, and user perception of quality, and that the device display type impacts user information assimilation and user perception of quality. Finally, to ensure the transfer of information, low-level abstraction (network-level) parameters, such as delay and jitter, should be adapted; to maintain the user's level of enjoyment, high-level abstraction quality parameters (content-level), such as the appropriate use of display screens, should be adapted.},
